# Maple-Rust
An interpreter for the Maple Programming Language written in Rust.

## What is Maple?
Maple derives from Rust and thus has a similar syntax, supports implicit type
declarations, infix operators, Strings, integers, real numbers and boolean literals. 
The language supports explicit pass by reference and can form complex structures 
while some exist in the standard library.

Maple documentation exists under [docs](docs).

The specification docs also contain all the explanations as asked under the PLC
extra credit for CSC 4330.

### Credits
A lot of this interpreter based on Rydgel's interpreter for the monkey language found
[here](https://github.com/Rydgel/monkey-rust).
